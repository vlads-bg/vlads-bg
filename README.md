### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Vlads Barcelos Godoi

I've been working with software development for more than 12 years.

I have knowledge in architectural modernizations using distributed systems concepts, such as messaging, API gateway, cloud-native and tools such as Kafka, Kubernetes and AWS services.

Finally, experience with languages â€‹â€‹such as Java and JavaScript. I would also highlight other technologies such as Kafka, PostgreSQL, Oracle database and other services on AWS. Usually in a context using CI/CD, Git, GitOps and other agile principles.

- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently working at [Philips](https://www.philips.com.br/) as software architect.
